Pete8051: The code I pulled down barely had anything to it. It appears that you did little more than make a new app and added two full screen buttons to it, one per window, and they switch between each other when clicked. The one click window trick isn't bad, persay, as I did the same thing in mine but there isn't anything else to this app besides that. It doesn't help that the information is incomplete either, I can see the fields in the titles for the buttons but nothing of worth or merit is actually filled into them. The app runs, which is good, but that's about it.
I suggest filling in the details of your subjects, and perhaps make them into their own label views (easier to edit and modify text with). You can add event listeners to more than just buttons, you can add them to views, images, even entire windows so you can have a lot more freedom in what you want to put on each of your windows without feeling constrained to button usage.
